Image classification
### Project description
In this Project, we tried pre-trained models such as Yolo and Resnet to classify a dataset of 577 images. although data size is small, these two models do a perfect job on classifying images into four categories.
### dataset 
Our data was collected by taking photos of four different hand gestures including, Peace Sign, Thumbs Up, Fist, and Open Palm

# Models
1. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
   Trying to design different layers to extract the features related to each class, so that after training it could classify some new images as (validation set),  we did not reach accuracy of more than 28% even with a complex layers and regularization methods. Thus, the small size of our dataset makes such strong DL architecture useless.
